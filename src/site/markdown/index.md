<h3 class='no-before'>About</h3>

**Tint** (The Italian NLP Tool) is a Java-based pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Italian.
It is very fast and accurate, and implements most of the common linguistic tools, such as part-of-speech tagging and
dependency parsing.
The tool is based on [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), and can be used
as a stand-alone tool, included as a Java library or as a REST API service.
Tint also includes wrappers (for third-party tools) that use the CoreNLP paradigm and therefore can be applied to
languages different than Italian.

<h3 class='no-before'>Features</h3>

- Fast and accurate native basic NLP tasks (tokenization, sentence splitting, morphological analysis, lemmatization)
- Modules for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and named entity recognition use state-of-the art technologies
- It includes wrappers for entity linking, time expression identification, keywords extraction, hyphenation, geocoding.
- Extensible interface, through Stanford CoreNLP library
- REST API service included, built on top of [Grizzly](https://grizzly.java.net/)
